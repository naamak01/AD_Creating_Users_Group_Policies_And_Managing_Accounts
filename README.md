# Creating Users, Group Policy, and Managing Accounts with Active Directory in Azure

## Description

**This project will demonstrate how to configure Remote Desktop for non-administrative users, automate user creation with PowerShell, and manage group policies. Additionally, Iâ€™ll cover account lockouts and log monitoring to simulate a real-life IT environment. Join me as I dive deeper into deploying Active Directory and enhancing system management skills!**

This is a continuation of the [Active Directory: Deploying Active Directory](https://github.com/naamak01/AD_Deploying_Active_Directory) in Azure project.

You can find the Powershell script I run in this project here.
