# Creating Users, Group Policy, and Managing Accounts with Active Directory in Azure

## Description

**This project will demonstrate how to configure Remote Desktop for non-administrative users, automate user creation with PowerShell, and manage group policies. Additionally, Iâ€™ll cover account lockouts and log monitoring to simulate a real-life IT environment. Join me as I dive deeper into deploying Active Directory and enhancing system management skills!**

This is a continuation of the [Active Directory: Deploying Active Directory](https://github.com/naamak01/AD_Deploying_Active_Directory) in Azure project.

You can find the Powershell script I run in this project [here](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1).

## Environments and Utilities Used
* Microsoft Azure
* Virtual Machines
* Remote Desktop Connection
* Active Directory

## Operating Systems Used
* Windows Server
* Windows 10

## Project Walk-through: 

To start, log into client-1 as the domain admin (jane_admin), using Remote Desktop Connection:
NOTE: It will take some time to load since it will be the first time login in as a client

I want to allow Remote Desktop for non-administrative users. So, right-click on the start button > System > on the right-side click "Remote Desktop" > "Select users that can remotely access this PC":

Add "DOMAIN USERS" To allow all users
Here, enter "Domain Users" > Check Names > OK > OK. Now all domain users can access this client via Remote Desktop:

Next, we'll create a bunch of users in Powershell. To start, log into the DC (Domain Controller) as our admin (jane_admin):

Use Ctrl + S and save this like so:
Now, we can copy and paste the user creation script in the top section and click the "Run" button which has a green play symbol located in the top bar:

Powershell will begin to run the script and create random users and place them in the OU (Organizational Unit), we created in the previous section of this project, named "_EMPLOYEES". We can check by searching "Active Directory Users and Computers" > mydomain.com > _EMPLOYEES. Here we will pick a user and log into client-1 using this username and the password the script sets for all of these users which is "Password1":

Now, log out of Jane's account on client-1:

We can log back into client-1 using our newly created user, making sure to specify the context of which we want to log in by adding "mydomain.com\" before the username:

Even opening the command line you can tell the user name is there in the C drive

When we're logged in we can see a user folder for our user if we click on file explorer > C: > Users. We can also see the folder for the other users that have signed into this client. However, we cannot access them, because we don't have those permissions as a user:
